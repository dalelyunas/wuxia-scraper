wuxia-scraper
===========

A python scraper used for wuxiaworld.com to generate pdfs from stories. The pdfs are formatted and use the EB Garamond font. The pdfs can also be emailed directly to a kindle where they get converted to the kindle format.

The scraper currently works on books that meet these conditions:
* the url is in the format: /**{book_index}**-index/**{book_chapter}**-chapter-**{number}**/ 
* the chapters have a single horizontal line before the main text
